#Type Safety

- Never use stuff like // @ts-expect-error or // @ts-ignore
- Never convert variables with "someVar as any", if there is no viable type you should create one
   - if its not possible to create a type use "as unknown" instead of "as any". BUT THIS SHOULD REALLY ONLY HAPPEN IN EMERGENCY CASES!
